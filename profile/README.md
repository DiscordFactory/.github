Don't waste time reinventing the wheel when designing your discord bots.

Discord Factory is the first [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) framework designed to quickly and easily create a clean, maintainable, standards-compliant application.

In addition, you will benefit from modules dedicated to the framework that simplify the use of databases, command creation or events.

## Why use Discord factory

### ðŸŽ¨ Developer experience
> The development experience is at the centre of our concerns, in fact, a developer who does not feel comfortable with a technology or a language will have difficulty in appropriating and developing his project.
> In order to overcome this problem, we have chosen to implement at the heart of `Discord Factory` the use of [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html#class-decorators) which radically simplify the design of your commands or events.

### ðŸ“Œ Auto-import
> Traditionally, you have to import and then manually instantiate your commands or events in a single file that serves as the entry point to your application.
> `Discord factory` provides you with an auto-loader that will recursively import all your files without you having to worry about it

### âš¡ HMR
> Using Typescript means that your code will be translated into native javascript which will be executed by your version of Node.
>
>Don't wait any more between your saves before having a result.
>The Hot Module Replacement (HMR) allows you not to transpile your code and thus to gain in speed of development

### ðŸ“¦ Modular
> The `Discord Factory` framework offers ready-to-use modules to simplify your development
> such as [storage-next](https://github.com/DiscordFactory/storage-next) which allows you to interact
> with a SQLite3 database to persist data from your application.
